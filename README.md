# Deep-Learning
# Lab1
Implement simple neural networks with forwarding pass and backpropagation using two hidden layers.
# Lab2
Implement simple EEG classification models which are EEGNet, DeepConvNet with BCI competition dataset. Additionally, try different kinds of activation function including ReLU, Leaky ReLU, ELU.
