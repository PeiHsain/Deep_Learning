# Deep-Learning
# Lab1
Implement simple neural networks with forwarding pass and backpropagation using two hidden layers.
# Lab2
Implement simple EEG classification models which are EEGNet, DeepConvNet with BCI competition dataset. Additionally, try different kinds of activation function including ReLU, Leaky ReLU, ELU.
# Lab3
Analysis diabetic retinopathy (糖尿病所引發視網膜病變) in the following three steps. 1. write your own custom DataLoader. 2. classify diabetic retinopathy grading via the
ResNet architecture. 3. calculate the confusion matrix to evaluate the performance.
# Lab4
Implement a conditional VAE for video prediction. The model should be able to do prediction based on past frames.
# Lab5
Implement a conditional GAN to generate synthetic images according to multi-label conditions.
# Lab6
Implement two deep reinforcement algorithms: 
(1) solve LunarLander-v2 using deep Q-network (DQN)
(2) solve LunarLanderContinuous-v2 using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
